    If atoms are the basic building blocks of matter,
    then the atoms of our interfaces serve as the foundational
    building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces.
    These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels,
    inputs, buttons, and others that can’t be broken
    down any further without ceasing to be functional.
